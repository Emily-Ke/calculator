# Simple Calculator

This is a basic ten digit calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides whole numbers.

The calculator can be used by clicking the visible keys on screen, tabbing through the visible keys 
(`Shift``Tab` to move backwards), or using the numeric keys on your keyboard.

It is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. The keyboard is laid-out with CSS Grid.
